TODO:
	- check in Aquarium about recommended TimeOut value

System properties:
	- N = 3F + 1. Current default: N = 4, F = 1
	- Communication is done using SSL.
	- Can withstand crash failures from F servers. 
	- Can withstand malicious messages from F servers.
	- The system may handle many clients simultaneously.
	- Every client may store and retrieve as much secret as he desires.
	- Code implementation is fully based on the BGW protocol configuration which was introduced on the exercise.
	- "Store" and "Retrieve" Operations Implementations ae based on the protocols which were introduced on the exercise.
	- The implementation contains a GUI interface through which a client can store and retrieve a secret.


Usage:

	1. First, create service network:
		- run DiscoverServer instance
		- run BroadcastServer instance
		- run 4 Server instances - for each server - type 'b' if you wish that the server will act malliciously, 
		  (in particular - may crash), otherwise type anything else (Remember: only F=1 server may be faulty)

	2. Open GUI.

	3. To store a value, a client must do the following:
		- Click on the "Store" icon.
		- "Name" field:		Insert a name which will represent the current <key, value> storing process. 
		- "Key" field:		Insert a key (with that key - a client may retrieve his Value back).
		- "Value" field:	The value that the client wants to keep as secret.

	4. To retrieve a value which was stored earlier, a client must do the following:
		- Click on the "Retrieve" icon.
		- "Name" field:		The client should insert the name which was associated with the storing process.
		- "Key" field:		The client should insert the key which is associated with the stored secret (value).
		- If the inserted "Name" and "Key" were indeed used the store a "Value" in the past, in the end of the "Retrieve"
		  process, the client will get his "Value" back.

Remarks:
	- The "Name" is unique per store-retrieve process. 
	  Every <key, value> store and retrieve session must be associated with a unique "Name", 
	  i.e. don't use the same "Name" for different <key,value> storing sessions. 
	- In order to gain full UI the client must go to: Tools -> Top Secret, in the GUI menu (Linux only).
